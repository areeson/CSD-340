                        <td id="p">Being a swimmer for 6 years through middle school and high school, I began life with a semi athletic foundation. Once I left for college I was no longer on a team and found myself gravitating to the gym with a couple of friends. Fast forward 7 years and I now take strength and mobility as a responsibility towards a long enjoyable life. One project that I chip away at is an app that will log some of the metrics I keep in my iPhone notes. I’ve tried a few other similar apps, but they don’t quite function how I’d like and this gives me a great passion project. </td>
                        <td id="p">Luckily, I grew up with a dad that was a fan of cars and enjoying them through car shows and appreciation for mechanical engineering. This led to my first car being an older BMW, one of their smaller coupes that gave me a great platform to learn how to drive on. Due to the nature of E36s, they grew a massive following in the racing culture, becoming a very popular car to work on. I’ve now had this car for 10 years and I know every square inch of the car. Currently I’m working on a front subframe overhaul including welded reinforces, polyurethane bushings, and an E46 yellow tag steering rack swap.</td>
                        <td id="p">Snowboarding has been somewhat of a relapse into an older hobby. From the ages of 16-18 I spent quite a bit of time at Mt. Crescent in Iowa where I built a great foundation to the sport. When college at UNL came time, this hobby fell to the wayside only allowing me one real snowboarding trip out to Colorado. Now with the recent society problems of covid, driving out to the mountains became one of the better trips available to me. With that I turned my 2009 Mazda 3 hatchback into a mini camper and began going out to practice the sport once again. The difference this time being that I was able to either work remote from an Airbnb or take my school work for Bellevue to a coffee shop. </td>

                        <td id="p">With my degree at UNL in Marketing and Management, I found myself gravitating towards sales during my junior year. This is where I began my internship at Sandhills Publishing, where it was a mix between marketing and sales. Once graduated I wanted to see more and get out of Lincoln, I off to Chicago I went. Here is where I started my first job out of college at Groupon working as a Business Development Representative. I became close friends with a few others that were trying to make their way from the sales floor to the tech side of the business. With a clear interest in tech, I went from working at Groupon to a position as an Account Development Rep at Litera. This position allowed me to start giving software demos on a day to day basis with attorneys from all over the country.</td>
                        <td id="p">Step back to the month of July in the year 2019. I had been out of school for about 6 months at the time and just working full time. I was beginning to realize the importance of continued education on your own time. I spent a lot of the next few months learning how to create a website for a travel blog I was wanting to put together. This process started with a WordPress website, then I wanted to learn more about HTML & CSS. Those trickled into JavaScript and Python over the next year. Overall, I ended up building a website for some freelance photography I was doing, a fitness blog, as well as a travel blog, although not all deployed. It was at that point I realized software was becoming more than just a hobby and it would be worth investing in the skill. </td>
                        <td id="p">Now I am working towards a Bachelor of Science in Software Development. This degree cover the overall process of developing software including topics such as: Foundations/Design, Python, Java, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Database Development & Use, DevOps, & Server Side Development/Scripting. It’s been very refreshing to take the step from pursuing this in spare time to now pursuing a career in software development full time. It’s also been especially nice to collaborate with others over software projects. Both for professional practice and to pick up on tips and tricks within the industry. As for now I’m trying to prepare in all ways possible to kick off strong when graduation comes in August.</td>
